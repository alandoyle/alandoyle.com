## What is it?

[(Pronounced Lur-Ugh - An Irish word meaning "Track, trace; seek, search for." )](https://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/lorg)

*lorg* is a framework and javascript free privacy respecting Invidious/Google Text/Image Proxy based on a simple, lightweight API driven Meta Search Engine.

It uses Google to return Text and Image searches, while it's Youtube search results are handled by an [Invidious](https://invidious.io/) instance.

## Features

*lorg* has a number of interesting features.

 * *lorg* is incredibly lightweight.
 * All Text searches have the tracking removed and a clean URL returned.
 * It can be configured so the Image Search returns a link to the image, rather than the page which includes the image.
 * It also has a simple API whereby and `Ã¬nstances.json`file can be configured with a number of URLS to other *lorg* servers thus spreading the search load.
 * It normally uses a random User Agent but can be configured to send through the connection user Agent or a pre-configured User Agent.

## Special searches

 * All searches with one or two words are automatically checked against Wikipedia. (e.g. [Star Wars](https://search.lorg.dev/search?q=star+wars&t=0&p=0))
 * Currency Convertor (provided by [Money Convert](https://moneyconvert.net/)) (e.g. '[12 GBP to EUR](https://search.lorg.dev/search?q=12+GBP+to+EUR&t=0&p=0)')
 * Current weather (provided by [OpenMeteo](https://open-meteo.com/)) (e.g. 'weather')
 * Your External IP (e.g. '[my ip](https://search.lorg.dev/search?q=my+ip&t=0&p=0)')
 * Your User Agent (e.g. '[my user agent](https://search.lorg.dev/search?q=my+user+agent&t=0&p=0)')
 * Word definition (provided by [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)) (e.g. '[run meaning](https://search.lorg.dev/search?q=run+meaning&t=0&p=0)')
