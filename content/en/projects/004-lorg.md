## What is it?

[(Pronounced Lur-Ugh - An Irish word meaning "Track, trace; seek, search for." )](https://www.teanglann.ie/en/fgb/lorg)

*lorg* is a framework and javascript free privacy respecting Google Text/Image Proxy originally based on a cut-down version of LibreX but now evolved into simple, lightweight API driven Meta Search Engine.

It uses Google to return Test and Image searches, while it's Youtube search results are handled by an [Invidious](https://invidious.io/) instance.


## Features

*lorg* has a number of interesting features.

 * *lorg* is incredibly lightweight.
 * All Text searches have the tracking removed and a clean URL returned.
 * It can be configured so the Image Search returns a link to the image, rather than the page which includes the image.
 * It also has a simple API whereby and `Ã¬nstances.json`file can be configured with a number of URLS to other *lorg* servers thus spreading the search load.
 * It normally uses a random User Agent but can be configured to send through the connection user Agent or a pre-configured User Agent.
 * An instance can be configured to be an "API-only" instance and won't present a search interface, or will redirect (if configured) to a specific URL.

## Example Config File

```php
<?php

return [
    "base_url"                 => "https://search.mydomain.tld", // This doesn't technically need to be set but doesn't hurt :)
    'api_redirect'             => false,
    'api_redirect_url'         => '',
    'api_only_forced'          => false,
    'api_disabled'             => true,

    "google_language_site"     => "en",
    "google_language_results"  => "en",
    "google_number_of_results" => "20",

    "opensearch_title"         => "lorg",
    "opensearch_description"   => "My private lorg instance.",
