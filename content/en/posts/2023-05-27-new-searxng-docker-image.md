# Why a new Docker SearXNG image?

Simple really. I couldn't find a simple, easy to configure SearXNG Docker image. I wnted to tweak the theme to my own liking and swap out the logos. None of the available Docker mages provided this functionality so I built my own image, based off the [official image](https://hub.docker.com/r/searxng/searxng).

---

# Where is the new image kept?

The image is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/alandoyle/searxng)
```bash
docker pull alandoyle/searxng
```
---

# How to use this new image?

Using the image is really simple.

It can be run via commandline:

```bash
docker run --name=searxng \
  -d --init \
  -v <MY_CONFIG_PATH>:/etc/searxng \
  -v <MY_DATA_PATH>:/var/cache/searxng \
  -v <MY_TEMPLATE_PATH>:/usr/local/searxng/searx/templates/simple \
  -v <MY_THEME_PATH>:/usr/local/searxng/searx/static/themes/simple \
  -p 8000:8080/tcp \
  alandoyle/searxng:latest
```

Or via Docker compose:

```yaml
---
services:
  searxng:
   image: alandoyle/searxng:latest
   container_name: searxng
   restart: unless-stopped
   init: true
   ports:
     - "8000:8080/tcp"
   volumes:
     - ./searxng/config:/etc/searxng
     - ./searxng/data/:/var/cache/searxng
     - ./searxng/template:/usr/local/searxng/searx/templates/simple
     - ./searxng/theme:/usr/local/searxng/searx/static/themes/simple
```

# What ports does the image use?

The SearXNG image only needs one port. Port 8080, the alternative HTTP port.

| Port       | Description           |
|------------|-----------------------|
| `8080/tcp` | HTTP                  |

---

# What Volumes are required?

The 4 paths needed for persistant data and configuration are displayed in the table below.

| Path                                            | Description                            |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `/etc/searxng`                                  | path for SearXNG configuration files   |
| `/var/cache/searxng`                            | path for SearXNG data/cache files      |
| `/usr/local/searxng/searx/templates/simple`     | path for SearXNG template files        |
| `/usr/local/searxng/searx/static/themes/simple` | path for SearXNG template static files |

These Volumes are required so all SearXNG settings and themes are kept whenever the Docker container is restarted.

NOTE: On first run these Volumes are populated with the default files required to get SearXNG up and running and ready to begin configuring.

To customize the 'Simple' template used by SearXNG by default edit the files within the 'template' and 'theme' folders populated by SearXNG on first run. Here is wher you can change the log, etc. of the SearXNG site so it is a more personalised search engine.
