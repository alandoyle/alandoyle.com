# Minimal Setup Script

Earlier this year (2025) I’ve [written about a simple bash script](/blog/proxmox-initial-setup/) I wrote to setup a freshly installed Proxmox Virtualization or Backup server. However, I've been asked for a minimal version that just sets up the bare essentials on a Proxmox install without adding any extra software/aliases/etc., so here it is.

The script only makes a few essential changes to the Proxmox server. 

  - Enable IOMMU
  - Enable “No subscription” repositories.
  - Disable “Nag popup” in the web UI.
  - Update the CPU to the latest microcode. 
  - Update firmware to latest available. 

# Installation

To install this script on a freshly installed Proxmox server run the following command as root via ssh. 

``` bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/alandoyle/proxmox-setup/raw/main/proxmox-minimal-setup)"
```

After a reboot the initial install is complete.

## Note

Only run this script on a *freshly installed* Proxmox server. I've repeated this several times but it's worth repeating again.
