My name is Alan Doyle. No, not this [Alan Doyle](https://alandoyle.ca). He can sing, I definitely can't!

First, and foremost, I'm a father to 2 beautiful daughters. I'm an Irish (Dublin born) Software Developer currently living in Birmingham, England, although I do plan on returning home to my beloved Ireland one day.

I’ve been a Software Developer for over 25 years now, initially working on embedded Telco systems but currently writing cross-platform software to run on AIX, Linux, Open Server and Windows from a single common codebase for the Motor Trade.

My passion always was and always will be coding. I’ve been writing Software since I was 12 years old on the Commodore 64 my parents got me for Christmas, later I moved on to an Amiga 500 and Amiga 1200. However since I switched to PCs I’ve never been happy running Windows, I missed the passion Amiga coders had but now I’ve found that Open-Source software (particularly Linux) feeds that passion.

To whit, I switched permanently to Linux in 2005 to Ubuntu 5.04, I've tried dozens of distributions but I'm currently running [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/), tweaked to my liking, on my desktop PC and Teclast F5. Unfortunately, I do have a Window 11 PC used exclusively to play Steam and GOG games, so I can't seem to escape Windows just yet.

I manage several local and VPS servers and enjoy working with Proxmox, KVM, LXC and Docker to virtualize/containerize my private workloads.
